        <h2 style="margin-top:50px">Java TCP/IP Client-Server Project</h2>
        <p>
            In my sixth semester one of the courses I took was on mobile development with Java, which included a
            hands-on test that required me
            to create a TCP/IP client-server chatroom. This was pretty different from what I'd done to that point, which
            was almost exclusively done in
            C# and was more focused on developing stand-alone apps that would at most communicate with a database. It
            was also my first time doing
            any work with multithreading, which was difficult but enjoyable to work through.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project was really fun to work on I plan on going back to fix some of the issues I encountered while
            working on it at some point.
            Mainly, there are some issues with the way that I manage the threads which can lead to the servercrashing
            when too many command strings are
            entered too quickly. Regardless, I'm happy with the way that it turned out and it should be really easy to
            make the fixes required
            given the heavily object oriented approach I took while developing it.
        </p>
