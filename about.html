            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <p>
                    My name is James and I am a full-stack software developer in Welland and graduate of
                    Niagara College's Computer Programmer Analyst program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have a wide variety of experience in all facets of software development, as both an individual
                    and a team member,
                    building everything from SQLS data warehouses to complex point of sales systems for a local food
                    charity in Niagara Falls.
                    Some of the projects I'm most proud of, or even just had the most fun working on, can be found
                    in the
                    <a href="portfolio.html">Work</a> section of this site or on my GitHub page at
                    <a href="https://github.com/Hare-J">Hare-J</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am extremely passionate about building quality software following solid object-oriented design for
                    ease of future use
                    and development.

            <h3>Niagara College Peer Tutoring</h3>
            <p>
                During my second and third terms I was hired by the college as a peer tutor for a number of classes
                and helped over a dozen
                students to understand difficult concepts in C#, Javascript, and Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, to me at least, this was immensely helpful for my own learning as well, as it forced me to
                research simpler topics that
                might have been skimmed over otherwise. Additionally, it gave me extra practice programming simple apps
                through creating example
                and practice work for the students I tutored to help give more context to the content they were learning
                in class.
            </p>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom:15px">Community Project</h3>
            <p>
                During my fourth term with the college I helped work on a custom point-of-sales system for a
                local food charity.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this project I was part of a team of six students with the goal of designing and developing this
                system from the ground up, working with the client from the beginning to deliver the features they
                wanted to streamline different day-to-day tasks for their business. We ended up creating this system as
                a web app using C# and SQLite with the Model-View-Controller design pattern and spent four months total
                working on it.
            </p>

        <!-- MISSION STATEMENT -->
        <div class="row">
            <h2>My Mission Statement</h2>
            <i>Every piece of work you create represents you as a person and should be completed to the highest possible
                (and realistic) standard.</i>
            <p>
                While it can often be tempting to take the easy way through things, I have found that doing so rarely
                leads me to a place of positive growth.
            </p>
            <i>A team is only as strong as its ability to support its weakest members.</i>
            <p>
                In the past there have been many situations where
                I have been the one offering support, but also many where I felt completely alone and lost, and these
                have been my absolute
                worst experiences both for project outcome and growth. For the good of everyone, and for the good of the
                project, it is
                always the right thing in my experience to support your team above all else.
            </p>
            <i>Failure is an important contributor to growth and should be treated as a valuable learning
                experience.</i>
            <p>
                Some of the most
                important and lasting experiences during my development as a professional and as a person have been
                failures. Obviously
                it's better to avoid failure when at all possible, but that isn't always an option and if you're going
                to fail you might
                as well accept the discomfort and take away as much as you possibly can from it.
